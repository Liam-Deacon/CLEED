The development of the LEED-IV program package “CLEED” was started by G. Held in 1995, when he
was PDRA in Prof. D. A. King’s group at the University of Cambridge (hence ‘C’-LEED [1]). Further
development and improvement of the code took place at the Universities of Würzburg and Erlangen
(Germany) and is currently part of the LEED activities in the Held group.

The MAIN AUTHORS are (and/or have been):

    * Georg Held - Primary author
    * Wolfgang Brown - Symmetry (cleed_sym) code
    * Zhasmina Zheleeva - Angle of Incidence (caoi_*) code
    * Liam Deacon - CMake, Windows port, multi-threading & code tidying
    

And here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made CLEED that much better:

    * Jacopo Ardini     <j.ardini@pgr.reading.ac.uk>
    * Coinneach Dover   <coinneach.dover@mail.com>
