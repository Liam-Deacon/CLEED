This license applies to all the programs included with the distribution, unless

The philosophy behind releasing the CLEED package is to have
an open source set of programs for making Low Energy Electron Diffraction I(V) 
analysis both available to everyone and easy to use in the hope 
that we can build a thriving collaborative community, however the authors ask 
that if you use CLEED to help publish work, then please acknowledge the hard 
work that has gone into this by citing the reference in the :ref:`acknowledgements` 
section - Thanks!
