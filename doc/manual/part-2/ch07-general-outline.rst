.. note::
   OCR transcription from `doc/CLEED_Manual.pdf` (pages 15-16). Verify headings and
   syntax details against the PDF.

7.1 Syntax
----------

The basic syntax for running the LEED programs is described in the original manual.
This section requires verification against the PDF for command-line flags and their
exact spelling.

.. TODO:: (PDF p15) Confirm command examples, options, and any shell snippets.

7.2 UNIX-Environment
--------------------

This section describes the environment variables used by the LEED programs. The OCR
output includes references to CLEED-specific variables that should be cross-checked with
`doc/environment.rst`.
