Frequently Asked Questions
**************************

1. *I found a bug! What should I do?*

   The best first step is to contact the developers with:

   - a description of the problem,
   - reproduction steps, and
   - any relevant input/output files or logs.

   Alternatively, fixes are welcome via GitHub (PRs), or you can email a patch to
   `liam.deacon@diamond.ac.uk <mailto:liam.deacon@diamond.ac.uk>`_.

2. *Why does* :ref:`csearch` *stop without calculating the LEED-IV curves?*

   This could be any number of reasons, but the underlying cause should be
   outlined in either :code:`stderr` or the :file:`*.err` log file. If in
   doubt, `email us <mailto:g.held@reading.ac.uk>`_ and we can improve our error
   messages and instruction manual accordingly.
