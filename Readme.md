CLEED package
=============

Introduction
------------

CLEED is a computational package for Low Energy Electron Diffraction (LEED) 
IV analysis. It fits experimental IV data curves with those simulated by the 
cleed program and a 'goodness' of fit is made with the R-Factor program 
crfac. Optimisation of the input parameters is performed by csearch.

A (still rather incomplete) documentation of the program package can be found 
in 'doc/CLEED_Manual.pdf', but it is probably best to send an email, with all 
input files, to  <g.held@reading.ac.uk> for general LEED queries when you 
encounter any problems or alternatively email <liam.m.deacon@gmail.com> 
regarding problems/bugs in the programs.

Installation
------------

In order to target as many different systems in the simplest way the CLEED 
package has been developed using CMake as a dependency tracking and makefile 
generation program. CMake is available on all major desktop platforms and a 
GUI is also available for Windows users.

Use the following command in order to install CLEED for your system::

    cd /path/to/cleed/source
    cmake -G <generator-name> --build build/ -i
    cd build/
    <make> install

Where <generator-name> is the target platform e.g. "Unix Makefiles" or "MinGW 
Makefiles". <make> is usually "make" (Unix/GNU Linux) or "mingw32-make" 
(Windows). The '-i' option is voluntary, but is useful if you wish to be lead 
through the setup in a step-by-step fashion.

Note:: Windows users will require MinGW installed (other compiler tool chains 
such as MSVC and CYGWIN have not been tested). 

For those who have access to full CPython installation, it should be 
possible to install CLEED in an easier manner using pip::

   pip install cleed

If you have Cython installed on your system then the experimental Python 
bindings will also be installed so that you have access to the CLEED 
internals from your Python interpreter. Advanced functionality and a 
simplified, high-level interfaces are features that we would like to 
include in a future version.  

If you are unable to compile the programs, pre-compiled packages are 
also available.

Getting Started
---------------

On other operating systems check the compatibility of the trigonometric 
functions and data type used for real in "real.h" (in directory `include/`)

We have had a few problems on OSs different from DEC alpha with the
symmetrised version of CLEED (cleed_sym), therefore this is currently not 
supported in this distribution, but the non-symmetrised version should be 
running okay.

A set of sample input files for Er/Si(111) (no expt. IV curves), Benzene 
on Ru(0001) and O and Cu/Ni(111) can be found in under `sier/`, `rubenz/`, 
`nio/` and `nicu/` subdirectories in the 'examples/models' directory 
of the CLEED installation.
 
There are three files for each search (in addition to phase shifts and 
experimental data) which have to be created by the user:

* <bul_file> *.bul:
Bulk geometry and non-geometric parameters

* <inp_file> *.inp:
Specifies start geometry for the search and search parameters (symmetry etc.)

* <ctr_file> *.ctr:
Specifies correspondence between theoretical and experimental IV curves.

A detailed description of the file format can be found in 'doc/CLEED_Manual.pdf', but it is 
probably easiest to use one of the sample input files and modify it. 
All other files are created by the programs.
The search can be monitored through the *.log file; at each point of the search the 
current best fit geometries and IV curves can be found in *.rmin and *.pmin.

These files are all described in the CLEED manual.

The phase shift input must have the same format as for the VanHove/Tong 
programs with a first line added that contains the number of energies and lmax.  
For each type of atoms there must be a separate file in the directory 'phase/' 
called <atom>.phs. The directory is passed to the LEED program through the 
environment variable `CLEED_PHASE`.

Before starting any program 3 environment variables have to be set:

* `CLEED_PHASE` (see above)

* `CSEARCH_LEED` (path to executable LEED-IV program: normally cleed_nsym)

* `CSEARCH_RFAC` (path to executable R factor program: crfac)

A shell script doing this can be found in 'bin/set_env' (again, the 
directory path of the parent directory must be changed in this file). 
For users with a Python interpreter installed, the script 'set_env.py' 
allows much more sophisticated setups, for more details see:
    
    set_env.py --help

The search is started by::

    csearch -i <inp_file>

'csearch' is a master program that calls the LEED-IV program (cleed_nsym) 
and the R factor program (crfac) to calculate IV curves and R factors for 
a given trial structure and optimises the geometry parameters of the 
surface geometry in order to minimise the R factor using the simplex 
method (other search methods are currently tested).

The LEED-IV program can be called outside the search by

    cleed_nsym -i <par_file> -b <bul_file> -o <res_file> > <out_file>

<par_file> is usually created by the search program. It contains only the
positions of the overlayer atoms that are optimised during the search. 
An example is given in 'examples/NIO'. The LEED-IV program produces a lot 
of control output (written to stdout). Therefore it is best to redirect 
stdout to a file using the '>' command. It is best to check the LEED-IV 
program separately first, after you have made any alterations to the 
input file.

In order to test the R factor program separately, call it by:

    crfac -c <ctr_file> -t <output_file_from_cleed>

On Linux machines, for the search it is recommended to use the `nohup` 
command together with `&` which runs the search in the background::

    nohup csearch -i <inp_file> > <out_file> 2> <err_file> &

In the NiO111_2x2O example each iteration takes about 90-100s 
(2.4 GHz Linux PC), the final R factor after convergence should be 
around 0.1322 and it takes around 183 iteration to get there from 
the start geometry specified in Ni111_2x2O.inp (see attached *.log file).

The example in NiCu leads to an R factor of 0.0633 after 63 
iterations (*c.a.* 15s cpu time per iteration).

All information necessary to restart the search at the current 
position is stored in *.ver. If the search stops for any reason, 
e.g. because it has reached the limit of iterations (currently 2000), 
it can be restarted by::

    nohup csearch -i <inp_file> -v <ver_file> 1> <out_file> 2> <err_file> &

Good Luck!
