:code:`mkiv` - extract LEED IV curves from experimental data

:code:`mkiv` is a program which extracts IV curves of all beams 
(diffraction  spots) simultaneously from a series of LEED images 
taken during the energy scan. The only input required is the 
superstructure matrix as well as the image positions and indices of 
at least three spots at an arbitrary energy. Within the program the 
spot positions at any given energy are then calculated from the 
reciprocal lattice vectors and the position of the (0,0) beam
determined from the spot positions at the preceding energy.

.. _mkiv_background_information:

Background Information
----------------------
The real space surface unit mesh can be worked out from the geometry of
the LEED pattern, including any superstructure used by ordered 
adsorbates. It is the spot intensities, however, that carry information
about the atomic positions in the unit cell. Therefore, for complete
LEED  analysis, intensity-energy (IV) curves are measured for each 
diffraction beam.

The use of LEED as a structural tool requires  using  trial  and  error
geometries  for  the surface atoms, aided by a suitable search strategy
that optimises the agreement between theoretical  and  experimental  IV
curves, until a satisfactory fit between them is obtained. The process
is much like that used in X-ray crystallography,  however,  the  strong
multiple scattering present in LEED IV spectra is recognised as a
severe obstacle for direct methods.  To that effect, the agreement
between calculated and experimental data is quantified by a reliability
factor (R-factor), which is used to summarise the reliability of the
structural result in an absolute sense and to provide a basis for comparison 
with other structural determinations of the same surface and
with results obtained for other surfaces.

It is important to note that there is no way to ensure that the correct
geometry has not been missed in the list of plausible geometries. Just
as with X-ray diffraction, one is never sure that the "best" structure
found cannot be improved upon by a completely different structure.

Files
-----

.. _mkiv_input_files:

Input files
^^^^^^^^^^^
:file:`mkiv.inp`
  The primary input file used for determination of the output. See
  :ref:`input file <mkiv_input_file>` section for more details.
:file:`mkiv.var`
  The variable input file used for fine tuning of the data extraction. 
  See :ref:`variable file <mkiv_variable_file>` section for more details.
:file:`mkiv.pos`

  pixels from the reference image. See :ref:`position file <mkiv_position_file>` 
  section for more details.
:file:`<mask_file>`

  in black. This file must be of the same dimensions (width :math:`\times`
  height) and format as the LEED image files.
:file:`<LEED_image_files>`
  The sequence of experimental images used for extracting the IV data. 
  The files should end in an extension of the form :code:`.[0-9]+?.[0-9]+?[0-9]` 
  which is the energy of the incident electron beam for a particular image.

.. _mkiv_output_files:
      
Output files
^^^^^^^^^^^^
:file:`*.ivdat`
  The extracted I(V) output data. See :ref:`IV data file <mkiv_data_file>` 
  section for more details.
:file:`*.param`
  The parameter file used as a log of the variables used for the data extraction.
:file:`beam.raw`
  File containing the raw output from each of the spot beams.
:file:`beam.smo`
  File contained smoothed output of beam.raw.
:file:`mask.byte`
  Local copy of the mask file or else generated mask from :option:`ROUTER`
  and :option:`RINNER`.

.. _mkiv_input_file:
  
Input file (input)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This file is the primary configuration file.

:option:`REF_NAME`
  The name of the reference LEED image that is used to calculate
  the basis. The coordinates must either be input at the beginning
  of the program or be present in the file 
  :ref:`position file <mkiv_position_file>`.

  The  corresponding  energy  is  drawn  from the file header. The
  trunk of filename also serves as filename for the following LEED
  images. The extension :code:`.[0-9]+?[0-9]+?[0-9]` will be exchanged by
  the according index number.

:option:`NSTART`
  The first index of the LEED image sequence.

:option:`NSTOP`
  The last index of the LEED image sequence.

:option:`N_STEP`
  Determines the step width, may be used when calculating from 
  high to low energies or for a fast run for test purposes.

:option:`MASK_NAME`
  Part of the LEED image is covered by the electron gun and the
  support. This and the outer boundaries may by excluded from 
  calculations by using the mask. The VIFF-image should be of type
  VFF_TYPE_BYTE, a value of 0 indicating covered areas and 255
  indicating the visible  screen. The file might be produced by
  illuminating the LEED-screen from the back and taking a picture
  like a regular LEED-image. Then it may be converted into
  byte-type and into mask-type using a threshold color-value.

:option:`H_CENTER`

:option:`C_CENTER`
  Determine the geometric center of the LEED-screen.

:option:`ROUTER`

:option:`RINNER`
  Determine the radius of the LEED-screen and the electron gun in
  the same way as the former program version. Must be set even
  when a mask is used and therefore are not taken into account.

:option:`BACKGROUND`
  2 or 3
  <2 - not implemented anymore (former program versions)
  2  - performing background-subtraction
  3  - no background-treatment

:option:`SMOOTH`
  >0 - The value >0 is taken as constant beam-current value
  0  - Beam-current is taken as it is.
  -1 - The beam-current is smoothed (10 point backwards)

:option:`KP_LEN_10`
  The parallel (to surface) length of the (1,0)-vector in k-space.

:option:`NDOM`
  Number of superstructure domains.

:option:`DOMAIN`
  Superstructure matrices in real-space. Each domain preceded by
  the word :option:`DOMAIN`.

:option:`NDESIRE`
  Number  of  spots that are stored in :file:`mkiv.ivdat`, followed by the
  Miller indices of the :option:`NDESIRE` spots:
  :math:`h_1`  :math:`k_1`    > spot 1
  :math:`h_2`  :math:`k_2`    > spot 2, etc.
  .       .
  .       .

.. _mkiv_variable_file:
               
Variable file (input)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This file contains additional configuration parameters for fine tuning
the IV extraction process. The parameters available are:

:option:`COS_MIN`

:option:`COS_MAX`
  The minimum and maximum value for the spots used for the recalculation 
  of the basis. Diffraction spots close to the boundaries
  may be excluded this way.

:option:`VERH`
  The ratio of the axes of the underground-area to the integration-area. 
  :option:`VERH`=1.4 indicates disks or elliptical areas with almost the same 
  area of underground and signal.

:option:`ACCI`

:option:`ACCB`
  The  minimum  percentage  of the integration and background area
  compared to the complete disk area that must  be  within  masked
  area so that the intensity value is stored. A percentage < 1.0
  allows an overlap of integration areas with screen-boundaries.

:option:`DISTANCE`
  Minimum distance between two  spots  that  are  used  for  basis
  recalculation. Bigger values lead to more exact basis, too big
  values may cause too few reference spots thus preventing  sensible 
  basis recalculation. The value must be scaled with the size
  of the LEED-images, like :option:`SCALE_MIN`, :option:`RANGE_MIN`, 
  :option:`ROUTER`, :option:`RINNER` and spot positions are given 
  according to the resolution of the images.

:option:`UPDATE`
  The output files are flushed only every UPDATE image (senseless
  if output is buffered).

:option:`STEP`
  The routine :code:`fimax4` normally carries out the matrix-weighted 
  summation for every pixel within range. This time-consuming habit
  isn't  always  sensible, therefore a step-size may be used. STEP
  has no effect on the second run for the spots with bad signal-to-noise 
  ratios.

:option:`TRIP_MAX`
  Gives  the  maximum of triples for basis recalculation. The rou-
  tine :code:`calcbase` stops when the number of triples is exceeded.

:option:`SCALE_MIN`
  This is a minimum value for the energy-dependent integration
  area (in pixels). Prevents the area from becoming too small with
  high energies. If applied, different k-space is integrated  with
  different energies.

:option:`RANGE_MIN`
  Same as :option:`SCALE_MIN`, but for search area. Value should be in pixels.

:option:`S2N_REF`
  A minimum threshold for the reference reflections (spots) used
  for basis recalculation.

:option:`S2N_GOOD`
  Spots with lower signal-to-noise ratio are treated in the second
  run with smaller range.

:option:`S2N_BAD`
  Serves to call spots 'bad', no other consequences.

:option:`REF_MIN`
  A minimum number of reference spots to be taken into account. If
  less reference spots are found, all spots with a signal-to-noise
  ratio greater than :option:`S2N_REF` are taken instead. Reference spots
  are indicated by a 'r' preceding the indices in file :file:`mkiv.inp`.

:option:`SEC_RANGE`
  Tells  the ratio between the axes of search-area of first run to
  second run. spots with bad S2N are therefore searched within an
  area determined by :option:`RANGE` / :option:`SEC_RANGE`.

:option:`RANGE`
  Indicates  the size of the searching area in units of the length
  of the (1,0) basis-vector. The searching area therefore scales
  like the basis-vectors with the square root of the energy.

:option:`SCALE_A`

:option:`SCALE_B`
  Determines the size of the integration area in units of the
  length of the (1,0) basis-vector. The integration area therefore
  scales like the basis-vectors with the square root of the energy.

:option:`ANGLE`
  Indicates the angle between elliptical integration area axis and
  horizontal.

:option:`RATIO`
  This  is  the ratio of LEED-screen radius to the distance of the
  camera to the LEED-screen and is used within a geometrical correction 
  formula. The finite  distance  of  the camera and the
  spherical LEED-screen lead to this distortion. The formula is
  used when calculating the spot positions and in reverse when
  recalculating the basis with the found spot positions at the end
  of each energy loop.

:option:`<spots>`
  A list of diffraction spots are needed for :code:`mkiv` to determine
  which reciprocal lattice indices should be extracted. They take
  the form: :code:`h  k (d_par: d k_r: kx, ky, kz)`, where h and k are
  the Miller indices of the spot. The bracketed line section is
  optional. Furthermore list entries which start with 'r' are used
  as reference indices in order to calculate the reciprocal lattice 
  mesh (a minimum of 3 are required).

.. _mkiv_position_file:
              
Position file (input)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A list of reference spot positions from the reference image are used to
calculate the reciprocal lattice are provided in this file, which takes
the following format:

.. _mkiv_data_file:
       
IV data file (output)

This is a matrix of the energy (first column) and each spot reflection
stated in the list of Miller indices within the :file:`*.inp` file. 
The first two rows provide h and k for that column, respectively.

Notes
-----
Both :file:`*.inp` and :file:`*.var` input files contain the parameters 
in arbitrary sequence. The values are preceded by the parameter names that 
are mentioned above. If a parameter occurs more than one time, the last value
is taken. If it doesn't occur at all and a sensible value can be preset, 
the program takes such values. Be careful with that option because
the program will not mention if you forget a value and it is preset by
its own value. The used parameter values might be controlled in output
file.

Caveats
-------
:code:`mkiv` currently only supports 8 or 16 bit TIFF files and relies on a
conversion to the archaic xvimage format for the image matrix data. Work is 
currently in progress to develop a modern version using Python and Qt to allow 
easier use and flexibility.
