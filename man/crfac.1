.SH DESCRIPTION

crfac is a computer program written in C which performs a comparison between calculated (theory) and experimental IV curves. The agreement is quantified in terms of the reliability factor (or R factor), which can vary between 0 (perfect fit) and 1 (uncorrelated). For most applications an acceptable R factor is <0.1 for very simple models and <0.3 for complicated structures. The program offers the choice between four different R factors that can be used when minimising a structural search. These are $R sub 1$, $R sub 2$, $R sub p$ and $R sub B$. The output R factor value is the optimum achieved by shifting the energy axes of the experimental and theoretical I\-V curves with respect to each other. This shift acts as a correction for any non-optimum value of the optical potential in the LEED calculations, which therefore need not be optimised by the
.B csearch
program. In this way, one dimension is eliminated from the search parameter space on which the search program operates, hence reducing the number of LEED calculations to be performed. The assignment of experimental and theoretical I\-V curves (or average of curves) for comparison, and of the relative weight that a particular I\-V curve has in the overall R factor, is performed prior to the search.

.SH OPTIONS

.IP -a
.I <ID_flag>
.RS
defines whether only the average R factor is calculated (argument 'average' is the default) or partial R factors for each subset of IV curves sharing a common ID number (argument 'all'). Only the first two characters are significant.
.RE
.IP -c
.I <control_file>
.RS 
specifies the control file which defines the correlation between experimental and theoretical IV curves. Further information regarding the control file structure is provided in the CONTROL_FILE section.

.RE
.IP -h 
.RS 
causes the program to show a short list of arguments. 
.RE
.IP -o
.I <output_file>
.RS
specifies the output file where the R factor values are written to (default: standard output).
.RE
.IP -r
.I <R_factor>
.RS
specifies the R factor type to be calculated. Valid arguments are:
.br
'r1' : calculate $R sub 1$
.br
'r2' : calculate the mean-square displacement $R sub 2 = {sum {(c I sub expt - I sub theory)} sup 2} / sum I sub theory sup 2$, where $c$ is a scaling factor.
.br
'rb' : (calculates $R sub B1$ and $R sub B2$)
.br
'rp' : calculates the Pendry R factor $R sub p$. This provides the level of agreement on shape of curves, not the intensity by comparing logarithmic derivatives, $R sub p = {1 over I(E)} * {delta I(E) over delta E}$, and is the standard in I(V) analysis. The Pendry R factor is problematic with experimental noise as it is sensitive to positions of peaks, not intensity and therefore noisy data will result in extra 'peaks'. The workaround for this is to smooth or average the experimental data using a tool such as 
.B ftsmooth
.RE
.IP -s
.I <shift1,shift2,shift3>
.RS
defines the range (shift1 and shift2) and step width (shift3) of the energy shifts between the experimental and theoretical curves.
.RE
.IP -t
.I <theoretical_file>
.RS
specifies the file containing the theoretical IV curves. This is the CLEED 
.B *.res
results file from the csearch program. See 
.I csearch(1)
for more information. 
.RE
.IP -v 
.I <optical_potential>
.RS 
specifies the value of the optical potential $V sub i$ (in eV) used in the evaluation of Pendry's R-factor ($R sub p$). $2 V sub i$ determines smallest resolvable features in the IV curves. The default is 4 eV, however in situations where the interlayer spacings are very small, such as for intermetallic compounds, $V sub i$ may need to be increased (but should remain <5eV). 
.RE
.IP -V 
.RS 
give version and additional information about this program. 
.RE
.IP -w
.I <IV_output_prefix>
.RS
causes the program to write all normalised IV curves as energy/intensity pairs to separate files so that they can be plotted. <IV_output_prefix> specifies the base filename to which the letters 'e' (experimental) or 't' (theoretical) as well as the number of the pair of curves is appended.
.RE

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The program has been developed in a UNIX environment and uses a few UNIX specific features. The most important is the use of environment variables.
.PP
.B RF_HELP_FILE
.RS
File to be shown when the -h option is chosen if set in the system environment. 
.PP
This variable has to be set using the 
.I export
or 
.I setenv
UNIX commands, respectively, before the program is called for the first time.
.RE

.\" Document here situations in which the program can be used, if there are uses that are not obvious.
.SH EXAMPLES
.B crfac -w "iv" -c *.ctr -t *.res
.RS
Creates a list of experimental and theoretical IV curve files matching the regex pattern 'iv_[et]_[0-9]+?[0-9]+?[0-9]'. This command is valid if there is only one *.ctr and *.res file within the directory (otherwise the full filenames are required). The IV files can then plotted using a graphing package such as gnuplot, qtiplot, veusz or xmgrace.
.RE
.PP
.B crfac -c *.ctr -t *.res -a all
.RS
Prints a list of the individual R factors. Output can be redirected to a file (e.g. by appending '>rfac.txt' to the command) for a permanent record.
.RE
.PP
.B crfac -c *.ctr -t *.res 
.RS
Calculates the error (relative error) for the calculated R factor. The relative error is given by: 
.EQ
RR = ({8 V sub i} over {delta E}) sup half
.EN
, where $V sub i$ is the imaginary component of the optical potential and dE is the energy range of the data. This provides the error bars, $E = (1 + RR) * R sub min$, where $R sub min$ is the minimum R factor for the data. 
.SH NOTES

Both *.inp and *.var input files contain the parameters in arbitrary sequence. The values are preceded by the parameter names that are mentioned above. If a parameter occurs more than one time, the last value is taken. If it doesn't occur at all and a sensible value can be preset, the program takes such values. Be careful with that option because the program will not mention if you forget a value and it is preset by its own value. The used parameter values might be controlled in output file.

.SH FILES

INPUT FILES: 
.PP
.I *.ctr
.RS
The control file used by both csearch and crfac. This file contains the experimental curves to be evaluated against the theoretical ones. Each curve is a separate line (UNIX terminated) and take the form:
.br
ef=<experimental_filename>:ti=(<h>,<k>):id=<ID_number>:wt=<weighting>
.PP
The line syntax can be broken down into command character sequences as follows:
.br
.IP ef=
.RS
Experimental Filename: Specifies the path to the experimental IV curve. This is usually a relative path to ease readability. Also note that file paths containing spaces may not be read correctly resulting in an error.
.RE
.IP ti=
.RS
Theoretical Index: Specifies the Miller indices of the spot in terms of h and k. Both indices should be floating point numbers separated with a comma and enclosed in curved braces, i.e. '(' and ')'.
.RE
.IP id=
.RS
Identification: Sets a unique index (the <ID_number>) for each curve and is used primarily to help the user track the curves produced using the 'crfac -w' command. If none of the lines contain id=<ID_number> then the <ID_number> will be in the order in which the curves appear in the control file.
.RE
.IP wt=
.RS
Weighting: Provides a statistical weighting for each curve with a <weighting> value between 0.0 and 1.0 (default is 1.0).
.RE
.PP
.B Notes: 
.br
* Each command sequence must be separated using a colon ':'. 
.br
* Lines starting with an '#' will be regarded as comments.
.br
* Check lines are terminated with '\n' (UNIX end-line character).
.br
* The final line of the file should be blank 
.br 
  (for compatibility with older versions which threw an error).
.RE
.PP
.I *.res
.RS
The results file produced by the csearch program.
.RE
.PP
OUTPUT FILES:
.PP
.I IV_curve_files
.RS
Generated using the '-w' option in the 
.B crfac
command. Experimental and theoretical curves are indicated with '_e' and '_t', respectively. The number specified by the 'id=' argument will be appended to the filename of each output curve for identification.

.SH AVAILABILITY

crfac is available as part of the CLEED package and should be available on any platform where there is a GNU C compiler (GCC) tool chain. GCC is readily available on most Linux distributions, however Windows users can install MinGW, the minimalist GNU tool set for Windows.
